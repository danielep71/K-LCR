"""Reject tracked binary files outside the approved paths and the allowlist.

A file is binary when .gitattributes unsets its text attribute (the
office-doc, opaque and vba-form-bin rules and the byte-preserved regulatory
sources), or when a file Git would treat as text contains a NUL byte
anywhere, also past the first 8000 bytes, which are all that Git inspects. A
binary file passes only if it is:

- under docs/methodology/sources/, the byte-preserved regulatory sources;
- a UserForm .frx with its .frm beside it; or
- listed in .github/binary-allowlist.json with its current SHA-256 and a
  reason, as the prototype's template src/workbook/LCR_Template.xlsx and the
  social preview image are.

.gitignore keeps such files out by default; this check catches one added on
purpose, for example with git add -f.

An Office Open XML package that passes (a .xlsx, .xltx, .docx or similar
file, as a ZIP with [Content_Types].xml) also fails when it carries macros, a
vbaProject.bin part or a reference to one, or personal document metadata: an
author or last editor in docProps/core.xml, or a company or manager in
docProps/app.xml. Each part is parsed as XML in its declared encoding, so a
UTF-16 part or a character reference hides nothing, and a part that is not
XML fails too. The byte-preserved regulatory sources under
docs/methodology/sources/ are exempt: they stay as published. It never
changes a file.
