"""Check CHANGELOG.md and VERSION against the date and version rules of CHANGELOG.md.

It never tags or publishes a release. CHANGELOG.md starts with an ``## [Unreleased]`` section; each release
heading is ``## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`` with a real date, newest first by
version and date, with a link reference to its tag's release page. VERSION
does not exist before the first dated release; from then on it holds one
``X.Y.Z`` line, the newest release. With --repository, every link reference
to GitHub, not only those of the version headings, must also point into that
repository.

It also checks that the prose agrees with that state:

- the introduction of CHANGELOG.md, before its first level-2 heading, says
  "No version has been released" exactly while it has no dated release, and
  no version section holds a placeholder line such as TBD;
- the *Current status* table of RELEASING.md, when present, names no release
  and no VERSION before the first release, and the newest one after it;
- README.md, when present, holds no "Release Candidate" and no unchecked
  task-list item.

A released section is frozen: once its tag vX.Y.Z exists, the section, from
its heading to the next level-2 heading, must equal that section in
CHANGELOG.md at the tag. Only line endings are normalised. A section that
holds a dated note "Corrected after release on YYYY-MM-DD: <reason>", with a
real calendar date, may differ, and the difference is reported as a note, so
a reviewed correction stays visible. A
release whose tag does not exist yet is a note, since the tag is created
after the changelog is dated; so is a directory that is not a Git checkout,
where nothing can be compared. A shallow clone fails once a dated release
exists, since it lacks the tags and ancestry to compare. A vX.Y.Z tag on a commit that HEAD contains,
whose CHANGELOG.md released [X.Y.Z], fails when the section is no longer in
the changelog, so a released section cannot be deleted or renamed; a newer
tag does not apply to an older revision.
